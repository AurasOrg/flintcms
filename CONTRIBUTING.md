# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flint!

## Getting up and Running

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you are making changes to the admin dashboard, you'll need to add the `BUILD_DASHBOARD` variable to your `.env` file.

```
BUILD_DASHBOARD=true
```

Once that's done, you can go ahead and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Please discuss code changes before proposing a pull request by opening up an issue (especially if it's a new feature).

### Emojis

Using emojis in commit messages in more than allowed, it's preferred. They are fun and in many cases informative. That being said, if you do choose to put an emoji in a commit message, please do make sure that it has some kind of connection to the changes being proposed.
